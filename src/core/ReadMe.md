# mORMot Core Units

## Folder Content

This folder hosts the Core Units of the *mORMot* Open Source framework, version 2.

## Core Units

With "Core Units", we mean units implementing shared basic functionality of our framework:

- Uncoupled reusable bricks to process files, text, JSON, compression, encryption, network, RTTI, potentially with optimized asm;
- Other higher level features, like ORM, SOA or database access are built on top of those bricks, and are located in the parent folder;
- Cross-Platform and Cross-Compiler: ensure the same code would compile on both FPC and Delphi, on any support platform, regardless the RTL, Operating System, or CPU.
